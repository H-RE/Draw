To create the positions of the shape
first the center of the Edge is placed at a point with coordinates (0,0) and the positions first are placed with a function that dependents of thickness and with the shape oriented of horiozontal way.
Then rotate all positions around the center with an angle A
and finally displace all positions to the initial Point, simply adding X and Y to the center that was placed at (0,0)
